# What's next for Apple
So you have probably seen at least _some_ news concerning Apple this last week:

* ["Apples Darkest Day..."](https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPppIYl6TO4cR15boMQlg_sqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowjujJATDXzBUw6JS0AQ?hl=en-AU&gl=AU&ceid=AU%3Aen), 
* ["Is Apple still a forever company..."](https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlaS5vcmcvcHVibGljYXRpb24vaXMtYXBwbGUtc3RpbGwtYS1mb3JldmVyLWNvbXBhbnktaG93LWFib3V0LWZhY2Vib29rL9IBAA?hl=en-AU&gl=AU&ceid=AU%3Aen), 
* ["Apple: Beginning of the end..."](https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FwcGxlLWJlZ2lubmluZy1vZi10aGUtZW5kLW9yLWEtbmV3LWJlZ2lubmluZy_SAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3ctemRuZXQtY29tLmNkbi5hbXBwcm9qZWN0Lm9yZy92L3Mvd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9nb29nbGUtYW1wL2FydGljbGUvYXBwbGUtYmVnaW5uaW5nLW9mLXRoZS1lbmQtb3ItYS1uZXctYmVnaW5uaW5nLz9hbXBfanNfdj0wLjEjd2Vidmlldz0xJmNhcD1zd2lwZQ?hl=en-AU&gl=AU&ceid=AU%3Aen).

Its safe to say that Apple shareholders might be a little on the sadder side of life at the moment :laughing: (Im one of them... :sad:). 
BUT, all is not lost! I believe there is still a lot up the proverbial sleeves of our fruit themed friends.

## Why is everyone overreacting?

_Well... I suppose its worth asking first, are people actually overreacting!? **#fakenews** ??_

That aside, what is it that has people in a frenzy? 

Well it started with a little message that Tim Cook recently sent out to investors. This message basically warned investors that earnings are a little short of expectations this quarter due to lack luster sales of iPhones. Which, as one would expect in a world full of emotionally charged, consumer enabled trivializing, opportunistic (rant over :wink:) shareholders, has dropped stock value dramatically.

## What is actually going on?

It appears as though Apple overestimated how many iPhones they would be selling. Specifically in China. 

Now I can't be the only one who had this expectation, I mean Apple is really an overly romanticized Western brand. I doubt that China has even had the time to really absorb and understand what it is that makes Apple products stand out above the competition (which it really does ever so subtly). Especially when you think about the massive price tag attached to the iPhones compared to the current chinese market trends, which seem to gravitate towards phones that cost half the price and are VERY similarly featured on paper.

Another piece of the issue-pie that was mentioned in Tim Cook's message to shareholders, was that the trade war between US and China appears to have impacted their business somehow. I think I would like some more specific details on exactly how this is affecting them as I know that Tim Cook has become a little more political lately and I would not be surprised if there were other considerations at play here. :wink:

Lastly, Tim Cook mentioned that iPhone XR sales have not been performing as well as expected.

## Apples Current Position

So just to throw some sand on the fire here, I thought it would be interesting to analyze where Apple are actually sitting at this point in terms of market position.

Apple are a massive company, they have been around for a very long time and created a slew of products that everyone loves, and even established an amorous bond from their customer base. 
I honestly cant think of complaint that people have concerning their **products** aside from price _[People do however have plenty to say about their business practices, but that really doesn't go further than the normal big-business dislikes of the modern age]_.

I think its safe to say that their customers are not going anywhere. Their real issue at the moment is growth. They have been growing their revenue in the last several years on new people entering the smartphone markets. Unfortunately though, Apple smartphones have not been able to release any new revolutionary feature that would drive existing Apple (or competing) smartphone owners to making the plunge for a very experience newer model.

We are now seeing the effects of a saturated western smartphone market...

## Where I think Apple should go next.

Apple has the unique position of being able to launch a new product in nearly any technology centered market, and their devotees will no doubt be queueing up outside their stores once more.

Tech companies have become distracted in a way by the attractions of feature rich consumer devices. This is because it allows them to make revenue not only from the devices themselves but also from the services that integrate with those devices. Its an awesome business model because it results in a lot of potential profit from each device sold even after having sold it.

My opinion is that the IOT market has not properly been explored by these bigger companies.
We have seen some amazon entrants into the work of IOT in the form of the AI assistant products.
Google's Home and ChromeCast products are an AWESOME combination that even my grandparents wanted for Christmas (They are Apple fanboys by the way...)!
Amazon has a serious tantalizing lineup of IOT products as well, with the Echo products.
And the best part about these products is that they are all pretty cheap.
Cheapest offerings from Google are around $50 AUD, and its even cheaper for Amazon's Echo.

So now let's compare that with what Apple have been doing in the same space.
Apple released the Apple HomePod a little while ago. The launch did not go so well though unfortunately.

* They missed the holiday season.
* They are charging $500 AUD for it.
* And it didn't really do anything.

At the end of the day it was a glorified apple-device-only speaker (which it does better than all the competing products I will add). Apple did not back the device up with anything IOT related for controlling your home. Which really defeats most of the purpose of owning a **home assistant**. Apple!? You crazy!

Now imagine this: You come home from work, its super hot outside... Just as you realize you have to stop to find your keys to escape from the scorching abuse of the sun and your Apple HomePod uses its AI smarts based on the time of day and the sound of your car in the driveway to unlock the door and give you a little chime to let you know you can come on in. Or, alternatively, you dont need keys, just your iPhone (which was likely prioritized to be in the palm of your hand when you left the car anyway) with it's NFC connectivity touches your Apple Smartlock on your door and you voila, you have escaped the heat!

This, smaller device, everything is connected, Apple home ecosystem is where I think Apple has some real potential for growth and revenue explosion. They already have the consumer trust, the brand awareness, the technological know how, and likely the undying faith of the Apple cult.
