      <description>First Post I thought I should have a website&amp;hellip; Not really sure why? BUT, too late, its done. ðŸ˜‰
I have put this together using a pretty cool little tool, that seems to be gaining in popularity lately, called Hugo.
Hugo is a static sight generator built in the &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; language. Im not exactly sure of what it is capable of at this point, but there is no better way to learn then to try.</description>
